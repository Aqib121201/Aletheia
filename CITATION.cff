abstract: |
  Project Aletheia is a theorem-first, cryptographically-auditable allocation system 
  that unites ergodic control theory, convex geometry, stochastic processes, and 
  zero-knowledge proofs for fair resource allocation in housing and healthcare domains. 
  The framework provides formal verification through Lean 4 theorem proving, 
  practical implementation via Rust/Python simulators, and privacy-preserving 
  auditability through ZK-SNARK proofs. Key innovations include α-fairness 
  constraints with temporal consistency, entropy-based fairness duality, 
  and cryptographic checkpoints for distributed verification.

  abstract: |
    We present Aletheia, a novel framework for resource allocation that combines 
    formal verification, cryptographic auditability, and fairness guarantees. 
    Our approach leverages Lean 4 theorem proving to establish mathematical 
    foundations, implements α-fairness through ergodic control theory, and 
    provides privacy-preserving verification via zero-knowledge proofs. We 
    demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in housing and healthcare allocation 
    scenarios, achieving Gini coefficients below 0.3 while maintaining 94% 
    resource utilization and sub-second proof verification times.
