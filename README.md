##  What is Project Aletheia?

Project Aletheia is a groundbreaking framework that brings mathematical rigor and cryptographic verifiability to fair resource allocation. Named after the Greek goddess of truth, Aletheia ensures **transparent**, **auditable**, and **provably fair** distribution of scarce resources in critical domains like housing and healthcare.

###  Core Innovation

**Theorem-First Approach**: Every algorithm is formally verified in Lean 4, ensuring mathematical correctness before implementation.

**Cryptographic Auditability**: Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification of fairness without revealing private information.

**Œ±-Fairness Framework**: Generalizes fairness concepts from proportional to max-min fair allocations with tunable parameters.

**Multi-Domain Support**: Designed for housing, healthcare, and general resource allocation scenarios.

---

##  Key Features

###  Cryptographic Guarantees
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** using Groth16 and Halo2 for privacy-preserving verification
- **Cryptographic Auditability** without trusted third parties
- **Proof Aggregation** for scalable batch verification
- **128-bit Security** with industry-standard cryptographic libraries

### Fairness Algorithms
- **Œ±-Fairness** with configurable fairness parameters (Œ± ‚àà [0, ‚àû))
- **Entropy-Based Fairness Duality** for information-theoretic optimization
- **Temporal Consistency** ensuring fairness over time
- **Envy-Free Allocations** with approximate and exact variants

###  Formal Verification
- **Lean 4 Theorem Proving** for algorithm correctness
- **Convergence Guarantees** with polynomial-time bounds
- **Mathematical Foundations** in convex optimization and game theory
- **Reproducible Proofs** with complete verification pipeline

###  Domain Applications
- **Housing Allocation** with real Berlin market data
- **Healthcare Resource Distribution** for hospital bed allocation
- **General Resource Allocation** framework for custom domains
- **Multi-Resource Scenarios** with complex constraint handling

---

##  Quick Start

### One-Command Setup
```
# Clone and set up complete environment
git clone https://github.com/samansiddiqui55/Aletheia.git
cd Aletheia
make env
```

### Run Your First Allocation
```
# Generate sample data and run allocation simulation
make reproduce
```

This will:
 Generate Berlin housing allocation dataset  
 Run Œ±-fairness optimization algorithms  
 Generate zero-knowledge proofs of fairness  
 Verify all mathematical properties  
 Produce comprehensive results in `experiments/results/`  

### Expected Output
```
‚úì Generated 674-line Berlin dataset with 5 districts, 5 housing units
‚úì Converged to Œ±-fair allocation in 87 iterations  
‚úì Gini coefficient: 0.28 (excellent fairness)
‚úì Generated ZK proof (2.4KB, verified in 180ms)
‚úì All Lean theorems verified successfully
```

---

##  Theoretical Foundations

### Mathematical Framework

Project Aletheia implements the **Œ±-fairness criterion** for resource allocation:

```
maximize  Œ£·µ¢ UŒ±(x·µ¢)
subject to  Œ£·µ¢ x·µ¢ ‚â§ C, x·µ¢ ‚â• 0
```

Where `UŒ±(x) = (x^(1-Œ±))/(1-Œ±)` for Œ± ‚â† 1, and `U‚ÇÅ(x) = log(x)`.

**Key Results** (formally proven in Lean 4):
- **Convergence Theorem**: Gradient algorithms converge to optimal allocation in O(1/Œµ¬≤) iterations
- **Fairness Guarantee**: Œ±-fair allocations satisfy envy-freeness up to one resource
- **Temporal Consistency**: Long-term fairness properties are maintained under dynamic reallocation

### Cryptographic Protocol

**Zero-Knowledge Proof System**:
```
Prove: "Allocation A satisfies fairness constraints F"
Without revealing: Individual preferences, specific allocations, or private data
```

**Security Properties**:
- **Completeness**: Valid allocations always produce accepting proofs
- **Soundness**: Invalid allocations cannot produce accepting proofs (except with negligible probability)
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Proofs reveal no information beyond statement validity
