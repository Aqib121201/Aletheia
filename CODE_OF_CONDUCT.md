### Enforcement Guidelines

#### Progressive Discipline

We follow a progressive discipline approach, with consequences escalating based on severity and repetition:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

#### Special Considerations for Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct may result in additional consequences:
- **Retraction requests** for published work
- **Notification to institutional authorities** where appropriate
- **Collaboration restrictions** on future project contributions
- **Public acknowledgment** of misconduct in severe cases

#### Appeals Process

Any individual subject to enforcement action may appeal the decision by:

1. **Submitting a written appeal** within 30 days to appeals@aletheia-project.org
2. **Providing new evidence** or clarification not available during investigation
3. **Requesting review** by independent community members
4. **Participating in mediation** if agreed upon by all parties

Appeals will be reviewed by a panel of 3-5 community members not involved in the original investigation.
